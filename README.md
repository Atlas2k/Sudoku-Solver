# Sudoku Solver
This is a Sudoku solver that implements a backtracking algorithm to solve given boards.
A basic GUI was also made just to make the whole thing a little neater.
**Note:** The boards used to show off and test the program are not my own.


# Possible Future Additions
The GUI could be made prettier and more useful as I further learn the library used.
