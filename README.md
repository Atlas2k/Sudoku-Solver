# Sudoku-Solver
This is a sudoku solver that uses backtracking to solve the board. It's basic I know, but hey I'm learning.  
Note: The test boards were both copied from tutorials on the web. I promise I didn't cheat I just couldn't be asked to type out my own valid board.  
A GUI will probably added in the future.
